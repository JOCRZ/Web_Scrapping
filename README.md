### About
 1. What is web Scrapping?
 - Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.
 2. Why do we need to extract data from website?
  - We need data for research, analysis, making informed decisions, or creating useful applications. 
3. Why do we use Scrapping?
 - Web scraping enables you to collect data from multiple sources quickly and efficiently, eliminating the need for manual copying and pasting. With the use of web scrapping tools we can extract the information that we wanted rather than extracing everything from the webpage and when data is presented in a clear and organized manner, it's easier to analyze, make comparisons, and draw insights.

### Guidelines for web scraping Projects
- Ethical web scraping is crucial for maintaining a positive relationship with the websites you scrape from and ensuring the longevity of your scraping projects.

| Guideline                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Respect Terms of Use              | Always review and adhere to a website's terms of use, privacy policy, and robots.txt file. Follow any guidelines or restrictions they impose on scraping their content.                 |
| Use Legal and Ethical Practices   | Ensure that your scraping activities are legal and ethical. Do not scrape sensitive, private, or copyrighted information without proper authorization.                                  |
| Limit Frequency and Volume        | Avoid overwhelming a server with excessive requests. Implement rate limiting and avoid scraping too frequently to prevent server strain and potential IP blocking.                      |
| Use User-Agent Headers            | Identify your scraper with a proper User-Agent header to provide information about your program. This helps servers identify your scraping activity and intention.                      |
| Respect Robots Exclusion Standard | Check the website's robots.txt file to see which parts of the site are off-limits to crawlers. Follow these directives to avoid scraping restricted areas.                              |
| Crawl Politely                    | Avoid aggressive crawling practices that might disrupt the website's normal operation or impact user experience. Use reasonable intervals between requests.                             |
| Avoid Scraping APIs               | Whenever possible, use official APIs provided by websites to access data. APIs are more reliable, faster, and websites usually prefer you to use them over scraping their HTML content. |
| Parse Responsibly                 | Use appropriate parsing libraries like Beautiful Soup to extract data from the HTML structure. Respect the website's HTML structure and avoid overloading it with requests.             |
| Handle Errors Gracefully          | Be prepared for potential errors, timeouts, and server responses. Implement error handling to gracefully manage these situations and avoid crashing your scraper.                       |
| Cache Data Locally                | Save scraped data locally to minimize redundant requests and reduce the load on the website's servers. This also allows you to work offline and speed up development.                   |
| Monitor and Update                | Regularly monitor the scraping process and adapt to any changes in the website's structure. Websites may undergo updates that affect your scraping logic.                               |
